\chapter*{Conclusion}

The aim of this thesis is to propose and validate a generic and reliable elastodynamic wedge-diffraction model, valid for all wedge angles and for 3D incidences. So far, this had not yet been done in elastodynamics. This is done by extending a method called the \acrfull{sf} method and proposing the corresponding numerical resolution schemes. The principal results of this thesis are summarized in the following.



The results obtained during this thesis led to two publications in peer-reviewed journals \cite{article, articleelasto} as well to two communications in international conferences with conference proceedings \cite{DD2018,AFPAC}.

Some suggestions for future work are given below :
\begin{itemize}
\item In the final chapter of this thesis, the regular part of the spectral functions diverges in certain cases. Further investigations need to be made in order to find the cause of these divergences and a new method of computation needs to be proposed.
\item A thorough numerical and/or experimental validation of the code implemented to treat the case of 3D diffraction of an elastic wave must be conducted.
\item The \acrlong{sf} method could be further extended to treat dihedral interfaces between two elastic materials. This would be the continuity of Lucien Rochery's internship.
\item The \acrshort{utd} model was developed by Audrey Kamta-Djakou \cite{AKDthese} using the \acrfull{si} pole propagation algorithm. It should be adapted to the \acrshort{sf} method so it can be applied to 3D incidences.
\item The elastodynamic diffraction coefficients present a slight discontinuity at critical angles, due to the presence of head waves. In the continuity of Fradkin et al. \cite{FradkinDarmon}, further investigations must be made in order to model the contribution of these waves correctly.
\item In the final chapter, it was shown that for transversal incident waves with a skew angle higher than the critical angle, an evanescent longitudinal wave is produced. The asymptotic contribution of this wave should be evaluated more precisely.
\item Following the ideas of Kamotskii \cite{Kamotski2}, the Spectral Functions method could also be adapted to treat scattering by multiple adjacent wedges.
